## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that I still don't quite understand how positioning works.

### Continued development

I've been struggling a lot with implementing the position-elements, eventhough I think I understand the principle. The positioning doesn't seem to be ok on Safari and Chrome, but works on Firefox. I'll have to go through the theory again and re-apply in this excercise.

Changing colour in SVG's seems not to be that straightforward either.

Animation. But I didn't quite look into that yet.
