## My process

### Built with

- (Semantic) HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

First finished project in 4 months. I needed something 'easy' to finish, but I did eventually end up going back and forth between small errors. I used Flexbox, since I am not yet comfortable with grid. 

I continued reading on css and html. As such I came across the ch, which I wanted to use. Eventhough it's a newbie-excercise and I'm a less new newbie I wanted to use some of the extra stuff I learned.
Putting a transparent-border on the button, was once a tip of ApplePieGiraffe.

```css
p {
  line-height: 1.5em;
  max-width: 45ch;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm currently going through the flexbox-tutorial series of Kevin Powell and will move on to Wes Bos' Grid afterwards. But I'm currently moving slowly due to work.
